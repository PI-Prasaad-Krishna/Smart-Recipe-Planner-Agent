    "## ✅ Project Conclusion & Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook successfully demonstrated a complete, end-to-end multi-agent system. We built a **Concierge Agent** that solves a common, real-world problem—the \"dinner dilemma\"—by automating the entire workflow from idea to action.\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in the output above, the system:\n",
    "1.  Understood a vague user request (\"simple vegetarian pasta\").\n",
    "2.  **Agent 1** (the `RecipeAgent`) found a specific recipe and extracted its ingredients.\n",
    "3.  The **session state** (the ingredient list) was successfully passed to the next agent.\n",
    "4.  **Agent 2** (the `ShoppingAgent`) used its **built-in tool** (Google Search) to find a real, actionable location.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts Demonstrated:\n",
    "This project, though concise, clearly demonstrates **four** of the key concepts from the course:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Multi-agent system (Sequential agents):** We built a two-agent pipeline where the `ShoppingAgent` was dependent on the output from the `RecipeAgent`.\n",
    "* **Agent powered by an LLM:** Both agents used the `gemini-1.5-flash-latest` model to perform reasoning tasks.\n",
    "* **Tools (built-in tools):** The `ShoppingAgent` was given the `GoogleSearchRetriever` tool and successfully used it to find real-world information.\n",
    "* **Sessions & Memory (Sessions & state management):** The `ingredient_list` variable acted as the simple, yet critical, session state passed between the agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the time constraints, this project focused on a clean, robust, and clear implementation of these core concepts."
